# Overview

I am taking a Udemy course from Maximilian to learn about React, and this is one of his starting projects. I coded along to learn about how to use basic Redux functionalities including setting up central store, reducer, and dispatch to trigger the changes of the counter.

This project simply allows users to click buttons to either increase or decrese the counters. There is also a toggle button for users to hide or show the counter.
