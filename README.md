# Overview

This is a simple React counter project using basic Redux functionalities including setting up central store, reducer, and dispatch to trigger the changes of the counter.
 I am taking a Udemy course from Max and I used his starting project to code along, so I can learn all these skills.

This project simply allows users to click buttons to either increase or decrese the counters. There is also a toggle button for users to hide or show the counter.
